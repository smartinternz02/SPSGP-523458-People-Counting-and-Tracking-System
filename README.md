People Counting and Tracking System

NOTE -->
1) In the project folder, all the necessary files are present. 
2) DO NOT delete the "testvideo" folder even though it is empty, as it is required to store the uploaded video.
3) requirements.txt file contains all the necessary libraries.
4) As the Demo video is a large file, I have uploaded it in google drive and provided the link to it in a .txt file.
5) If the project_report.pdf does not work, I have also provided the google drive link to it in another .txt file inside the "project_report" directory.
